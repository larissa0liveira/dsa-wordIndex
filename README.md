# Word Index

Data Structures and Algorithms University Project.
This project builds an index mapping words from a text file to their line numbers.

## Features
- **BST-Based Index**: Stores words with ordered sets of line numbers.
- **OrderedSet Interface**: Custom ordered set implementation.
- **Search Functionality**: Retrieves words lexicographically greater than a given key.
- **Text Processing**: Uses `Scanner` with delimiters to filter punctuation.
